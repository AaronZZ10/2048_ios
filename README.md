# 🧩 My2048Game

A modern SwiftUI remake of the classic **2048 puzzle game**, built for iOS and iPadOS.  
This project replicates the addictive tile-merging gameplay — now with clean animations, sound effects, and a responsive UI optimized for all Apple devices.

## 🧠 How to Play

1. **Swipe** in any direction to slide all tiles.  
2. Tiles with the same number **merge** into one with double the value.  
3. Keep combining until you create the **2048 tile** (or push beyond!).  
4. The game ends when no moves remain.
